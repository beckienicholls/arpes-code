# arpes-code
# The files within this repository k-Warp ARPES data from the Diamond Light Source I05 Beamline from real space into momentum space. The unwarped data is input into the GUI as a NeXus file, and is output also as a NeXus file into a user defined directory. The resultant NeXus file can be displayed in the open source DAWN (dawnsci.org) software used at Diamond. 
# Please view the Documentation PDF file for more information on how to run the code.
